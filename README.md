## What is this? 

UselessYTDataExtractor is a tool used to analyze the metadata of a YouTube video and its comment section and produce some fun, but virtually useless data and displays it in pretty graphs. It can tell you things such as:

* what is the most commonly used word in the comment section?
* which words and phrases triggered the most replies?
* how much time would it take an average human to read all the comments?
* and answers to many other questions that nobody wants, and also nobody needs

Arguably the most interesting part of the data are the comments generated by an AI* based on actual comments under the video. The program takes all of the comments, parses them in a magic way and then produces sentences that in theory are similar to the real humans writing real comments.

\* it's not really artificial intelligence, but a simple algorithm; see the [section below](#randomly-generated-comments) for explanation
